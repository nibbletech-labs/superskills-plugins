# Marketplace Management Plugin

Browse and manage plugins from your SuperSkills marketplace through conversational commands in Claude Code.

## Included Skills

### marketplace-browser
Discover available plugins in your marketplace by asking Claude questions like:
- "What plugins are available?"
- "Show me database-related tools"
- "What's new in the marketplace?"

### marketplace-updater
Check for updates to your installed plugins:
- "Are there any updates available?"
- "Check for plugin updates"
- "What's changed in my plugins?"

## Installation

This plugin is automatically included when you install a SuperSkills custom plugin bundle.

Alternatively, install directly:
```bash
/plugin add file:///path/to/packages/plugins/marketplace-management
```

## Requirements

No API keys or credentials needed - this plugin works with your SuperSkills marketplace URL.
